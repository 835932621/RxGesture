## Usage

![](Pod/Assets/demo.gif)

To run the example project, clone the repo, in the __Example__ folder open `RxGesture.xcworkspace`.

You _might_ need to run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

---

__RxGesture__ allows you to easily turn any view into a tappable or swipeable control like so:

```ruby
myView.rx_gesture(.Tap).subscribeNext {_ in
   //react to taps
}.addDisposableTo(stepBag)
```

You can also react to more than one type of gesture. For example to dismiss a photo preview you might want to do that when the user taps it, or swipes up or down:

```ruby
myView.rx_gesture([.Tap, .SwipeUp, .SwipeDown]).subscribeNext {_ in
   //dismiss presented photo
}.addDisposableTo(stepBag)
```

`rx_gesture` is defined as `Observable<RxGestureTypeOptions>` so what it emits is the concrete type of the gesture that was triggered (handy if you are observing more than one type)

On __iOS__ RXGesture supports:

 - .Tap
 - .SwipeLeft, SwipeRight, SwipeUp, SwipeDown
 - .LongPress
 - .Panning(CGPoint), .DidPan(CGPoint)

On __OSX__ RXGesture supports:

 - .Click
 - .RightClick
 - .Panning(NSPoint), .DidPan(NSPoint)

If you are writing multi-platform code you can eventually write:

```swift
myView.rx_gesture([.Tap, .Click]).subscribeNext {...}
```

to observe for the concrete gesture on each platform.

## Continuous gestures

Some recognizers fire a single event per gesture and don't provide any values. For example `.Tap` just lets you know a view has been tapped - that's all.

Other recognizers provide details about the gesture (that also might be ongoing). For example the pan gesture will continuosly provide you with the offset from the initial point where the gesture started:

```swift
myView.rx_gesture(.Panning(.zero)).subscribeNext {[weak self] gesture in
    switch gesture {
    case (.Panning(let offset)):
        print(offset)
    default: break
    }
}.addDisposableTo(stepBag)
```

When you subscribe to the gesture you provide the minimum offset the user needs to pan before the recognizer fires. If you use `.zero` like above you don't require a minimum pan distance.

In the subscription closure you can pattern match the offset value and use it as you wish (full example is included in the demo app).

## Requirements

This library depends on both __RxSwift__ and __RxCocoa__.

## Installation

RxGesture is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "RxGesture"
```

## TODO

- support more gestures like Pan and Rotate
- defo add tests
- make pr to rxcocoa to add native support for rx_event to `NSGestureRecognizer` and remove the implementation from this repo
